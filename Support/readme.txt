==================================================================
Digital Retail Installation
==================================================================

Please contact the digital retailer through whom you purchased this 
game for instructions on how to install the game or how to 
download and reinstall another copy of the game.
 
Note: If you’d like additional information about your game as well 
as tips and patches please visit www.ea.com or www.eastore.com.

==================================================================
Installation Instructions
==================================================================

IMPORTANT: Before running Command & Conquer Red Alert 3, 
please be sure you have the latest drivers for both your video 
card and your sound card installed. An outdated video or sound 
driver can lead to slow and choppy gameplay, or in some cases can 
prevent the game from running at all. You can download the 
appropriate drivers from your video and sound card manufacturers' 
Web site.

Avoid running any other programs in the background, as this may
conflict with the game. This includes any virus-protection 
program that you have running, which can hinder performance.

To install Command & Conquer Red Alert 3 in Windows XP or
Windows Vista:

  1. Insert the Command & Conquer Red Alert 3 disc into your
  DVD-ROM drive.

     If the disc does not automatically launch when inserted in
     the drive, you may have the AutoPlay feature disabled. To
     enable AutoPlay, please consult your Windows user manual.

     If you are unable or do not wish to activate AutoPlay, 
     please browse to the location of the Command & Conquer Red 
     Alert 3 DVD-ROM using Windows Explorer, and double-click the 
     "EASetup.exe" application in the root directory.

  2. Follow the instructions that appear.
	 
  3. Please note that you must register an account at http://www.ea.com

==================================================================
Copy Protection
==================================================================

Command & Conquer Red Alert 3 uses SecuROM copy protection, along with 
Digital Rights Management (DRM). Below are some facts regarding the DRM 
in Command & Conquer Red Alert 3:

  1. We will authenticate your game online when you install and launch
     it the first time.
  2. We will never re-authenticate an installation after the first
     launch. There is no reaching out to a central server post-install 
     to see if you're "allowed" to play.
  3. You will be able to install and play on up to five computers.
  4. You are not required to have the Command & Conquer Red Alert 3 
     game disc in your computer to play.

In the case that you install the game five times, EA Customer Service 
will be on hand to supply additional authorizations that are warranted. 
This will be done on a case-by-case basis through contacting 
customer support.

==================================================================
Troubleshooting
==================================================================

Please be aware that an outdated video driver or sound driver can 
lead to slow and choppy game-play, or in some cases can prevent 
the game from running at all. To ensure an enjoyable experience 
with this game, be sure that you have the most recent video and 
sound drivers installed. These drivers are typically available 
for download from your system or hardware manufacturer's Web 
site. If you are not sure what type of video or sound card you 
have, or you need assistance with updating the drivers on your 
system, please refer to the documentation that came with your 
system or peripheral.

==================================================================
Optimizing Graphical Performance
==================================================================

Command & Conquer Red Alert 3 automatically selects a default 
graphical configuration that should be well suited to your 
system's specifications. However, you may adjust the game's
graphical configuration to suit your preference by selecting 
"Options" in the Main menu, then clicking "Settings", which takes 
you to the "Graphics" tab by default. Here you may set the screen 
resolution as well as a number of different sliders to affect 
different aspects of the game's visuals. Moving the sliders to 
lower settings may improve the game's frame rate at the expense 
of graphical detail. Try experimenting with different slider and 
resolution settings to find a configuration that best suits your 
preference.


==================================================================
Known Issues
==================================================================

You may experience problems attempting to run the game with a
monitor set to "portrait mode"--that is, if your monitor is set 
to display content vertically instead of in a traditional 4:3 or 
16:9 aspect ratio. Command & Conquer Red Alert 3 only 
supports monitors running in 4:3 or 5:4 standard modes, and 
16:9 or 16:10 widescreen modes.

As of the date posted at the top of this ReadMe file, Windows 
Vista is not compatible with ATI-based video cards with Radeon 
9250 chipsets and below, in addition to NVIDIA-based video cards 
with GeForce 5000 series chipsets and below. By extension, the 
game is not compatible with these chipsets on Windows Vista 
machines.

As of the date posted at the top of this ReadMe file, 
Command & Conquer Red Alert 3 is not compatible with nForce 2
motherboards using an ATI-based video card with drivers 7.9 and 
higher. The game is not compatible with this hardware 
configuration in Windows XP or Windows Vista.

Intel Celeron-based processor users may experience performance 
issues with the default graphical settings. To achieve increased 
performance, lower the graphical settings slider bar to a lower 
level of detail in the Options Menu. Attempting to run Command & 
Conquer Red Alert 3 on a Celeron-based system with a clock 
speed below 3.0GHz may significantly hinder game performance 
and is not recommended.

Command & Conquer Red Alert 3 does not support integrated 
graphics cards. Users with intergrated graphics cards may not be 
able to run the game, or may experience frame rate issues.

Some consumer routers, namely some models of the Linksys WRT54G, 
get disconnected from our online chat lobbies when the lobbies 
are under high load. This is a known issue and solutions are still 
being investigated.

There are known crashes that will occur on computers with ATi X1300 
series video cards and pre-SSE2 AMD Athlon chipsets. We are currently 
working with ATi to address the issue in a future driver release.

==================================================================
Multiplayer Information
==================================================================

When attempting to play Command & Conquer Red Alert 3 online,
please note that the minimum character length for your "Online ID"
is four characters. If you attempt to login with a nickname that
is three characters or less, the "Login" button will remain
inactive. Please also note that the maximum allowable length of 
an Online ID is 16 characters.

To automatically search for opponents using the 'Play Game' tab, 
the feature requires both players to ping each other. If you can 
connect to hosted Online games but can’t connect to other players 
using the 'Play Game' tab, please check your router’s configuration 
to ensure it is set to reply to ping requests.

If you lose Internet connectivity in the online lobbies or your 
network cable gets disconnected, it may take up to 2 minutes for 
the lobby disconnect to be detected in Windows Vista. This has 
no effect on disconnect detection during gameplay.

When watching a replay through the Replay Theater, you may fast 
forward the game-play by pressing the "." key (default).  Press 
the "." key again to resume the game-play to normal speed.  


==================================================================
Command Line Parameters
==================================================================

Command & Conquer Red Alert 3 supports several command line
parameters that may give you increased flexibility in the way 
that you run the game. To set a command line parameter, you need 
to do the following:

  1. Go to the location of the game's executable. This is
  typically found in C:\Program Files\Electronic Arts\Red 
  Alert 3\RA3.exe.
  2. Right-click on the RA3.exe icon and select "Create
  Shortcut".
  3. This will create a shortcut of the executable within the same
  folder. This will typically be called "Shortcut to RA3.exe" in 
  Windows XP or "RA3 - Shortcut" in Windows Vista.
  4. Right-click on this new shortcut and select "Properties".
  5. Add a space to the end of the string in the "Target:" field,
  followed by a "-" and then the command line parameter.

The following command line parameters are supported by Command & 
Conquer Red Alert 3:

   -xres (Forces the game to a specific horizontal resolution)
   -yres (Forces the game to a specific vertical resolution)


==================================================================
NAT/Firewall
==================================================================

If you are playing Command & Conquer Red Alert 3 behind a
USRobotics router, you will need to upgrade its firmware to the
latest version, v2.7 or later. See the USRobotics support Web 
site for details on how to do so.

If you are playing the game behind a D-Link router, you must 
check the "Send Delay" box in the Network menu for Command & 
Conquer Red Alert 3. To do this, in the Main menu select 
"Options" and click the "Settings" button, click the "Network" 
tab, toggle on "Send Delay", and click on the "Done" button. 
Additionally, if you are playing behind a D-Link DI-704, you will 
need to upgrade its firmware to version 2.75 build 3 or later. 
See the D-Link support Web site for details on how to do so.

It should also be noted that Belkin and USRobotics routers have
irresolvable issues specifically when attempting to connect to
each other via the 'Play Game' tab. Furthermore, Belkin and
USRobotics routers will have difficulty connecting to D-Link
DI-604 routers via the 'Play Game' tab.

If you are playing Command & Conquer Red Alert 3 behind a
software firewall, you will need to add the game's executable 
to the "Exceptions or Allowed Programs" list provided by your
software firewall. You will need to provide your software 
firewall with the actual path to the game's executable. This 
file is typically located in "C:\Program Files\Electronic 
Arts\Red Alert 3\RA3.exe". You will also need to add the 
"game.dat" file, which is located in the same directory 
listed above, to this exceptions list*.

There should be no need for you to use Port Forwarding/Port
Triggering to play the game behind your firewall. Command & 
Conquer Red Alert 3 should work successfully behind most
personal firewalls.

Command & Conquer Red Alert 3 uses the following ports:

TCP Ports:
80, 3783, 4321, 6660-6669, 28900, 29900, 29901

UDP:
6515, 6500, 13139, 27900

Additionally, if you are using a combination of a cable modem and
a router, you should contact your ISP/cable provider in order to
disable your modem's built-in firewall.


==================================================================
Administrator Privileges
==================================================================

Please note that you may not be able to add Command & Conquer Red 
Alert 3 to your software firewall's exceptions list if you
are not logged in as an administrator in Windows. You will either

  4. Click "Add or remove user accounts" under the "User Accounts" 
     heading.
  5. If User Access Control is enabled, then click "Continue".
  6. Select your account name from the available accounts.
  7. Click "Change account type"
  8. Select the "Administrator" radio button.
  9. Click "Change Account Type" and then exit the "Control Panel".



==================================================================
Audio Information
==================================================================

If some of the audio in the game seems to be missing, such as EVA
voice announcements ("construction complete", "low power", and so
on), this is likely due to your speaker settings. If your speaker
settings are set to a surround-sound configuration, but you do not
have a surround-sound speaker system, then some audio channels
will not be heard during game-play.

To check and adjust your speaker settings if your operating system
is Windows XP:

  1. Click the "Start" button in the Windows taskbar.
  2. Choose "Control Panel".
  3a. If your Control Panel is in the default Category View, click
  "Sounds, Speech, and Audio Devices". Then click "Sounds and
  Audio Devices".
  3b. If your Control Panel is in Classic View, double-click
  "Sounds and Audio Devices".
  4. Under the "Speaker settings" heading, click "Advanced".
  5. Choose the correct configuration in "Speaker setup" drop-down
  menu.
  6. Click "OK".

To check and adjust your speaker settings if your operating system
is Windows Vista:

  1. Click the "Start" button in the Windows taskbar.
  2. Click "Control Panel" in the Start menu.
  3. Click "Additional Options".
  4. Locate and click "Hardware and Sound" in the left column.
  5. Click "Manage audio devices" under the "Sound" heading.
  6. Select your speakers and click "Configure".
  7. Choose the correct configuration and follow the instructions
  that appear.

If you experience echoes when using the Voice Over IP feature 
during multiplayer games, please check that your microphone is 
correctly set as your current recording input source. 

To check your microphone settings in Windows:
  1. Open the Volume Control panel in your system tray in Windows.
  2. Select “Options” -> “Properties”.
  3. Select "Adjust Volume for" Recording.
  4. Select/enable all volume control options, specifically Wave 
     Out Mix and Microphone, and hit OK.
  5. Change the “Select” checkbox to Microphone.

Contrary to the system requirements outlined on the packaging, 
the Yamaha Xwave-512 has successfully passed our certification 
tests, and should be supported by Command & Conquer Red Alert 3.
