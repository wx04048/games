<h1>Online Connectivity and Performance Troubleshooting</h1>

<p>Online gaming is a fairly involved process. Several factors can contribute 
 (or take away from) a fun online experience. When troubleshooting online 
 performance, you have to keep in mind that you are not only dealing with 
 your computer, but also the computer you are connecting to. Every computer 
 your signal passes through can also affect the speed and overall quality 
 of an online game.</p>

<p>&nbsp;</p>

<p>Information transfer on the Internet is handled by shuttling bits of 
 information known as packets. For example, when you visit a web page, 
 all the parts of the page are passed to your modem in packets. Playing 
 online games is simply a matter of passing packets back and forth between 
 your computer and a server.</p>

<p>&nbsp;</p>

<p>One issue possibly affecting high-speed connections to our online games 
 is one of packets. Many high-speed modems have no minimum specified packet 
 size for outbound packets. When given a smaller packet, a correctly configured 
 router will pad the packet to an acceptable size and then pass the information 
 along. In the case of the older Internet router code, these packets may 
 not be padded and can be discarded or corrupted before continuing along 
 to the game server. The information passed through your modem to our servers 
 may be corrupted or discarded - resulting in lost information, disconnects, 
 lag, and other problems.</p>

<p>&nbsp;</p>

<p class="whs1">To check into this packet loss, you can run 
 a trace route program to see if there is any major loss on the way. We 
 use a trace program, <span style="font-style: italic;"><I>UO Trace</I></span>, 
 that was originally made for one of our games. This program can be used 
 for any online trace.</p>

<p class="whs1">&nbsp;<span style="font-weight: bold; margin-left: 40px;"><B><a 
 href="../Whitepages/UO_Trace.htm"><img src="../Red_Page.gif" x-maintain-ratio="TRUE" width="18px" height="16px" border="0" class="img_whs2"> How to use UO Trace</a></B></span></p>

<p>&nbsp;</p>

<p class="whs3">Another issue is the speed at which your system 
 processes the data and sends it our again. If your system meets the minimum 
 requirements for the game, make sure the system also meets the requirements 
 for playing on the Internet. These extra requirements can include: </p>

<ul type="disc" class="whs4">
	
	<li class=kadov-p><p>Proper connection speed</p></li>
	
	<li class=kadov-p><p>Higher memory requirements</p></li>
</ul>

<p>&nbsp;</p>

<p class="whs3">If your system has any virus scanning or Internet 
 security software running, these too can slow down your signal. These 
 programs check every packet that goes in or out of the system. Make sure 
 that all non-essential programs are turned off before starting the game.</p>

<p class="whs5"><a href="../Whitepages/Ending_Background_Tasks.htm"
													style="font-weight: bold;"><img src="../Red_Page.gif" x-maintain-ratio="TRUE" width="18px" height="16px" border="0" class="img_whs2"> How to end your background tasks</a></p>

<p class="whs3">&nbsp;</p>

<p class="whs3">Along with background tasks, make sure the 
 system is running at top performance. Make sure all of the drivers are 
 up to date. If the drivers are up to date, then it reduces the chance 
 of system hang ups which could create lag.</p>

<p class="whs5"><a href="../Whitepages/Updating_Drivers.htm"><img src="../Red_Page.gif" x-maintain-ratio="TRUE" width="18px" height="16px" border="0" class="img_whs2"> How to update drivers</a></p>

<p class="whs3">&nbsp;</p>

<p class="whs3">In-game details and options can impact packet 
 size and speed. The more details you have turned on, the more information 
 the game has to process. If you have any filters for text, these can also 
 slow down the game. Try lowering options to speed up game play. Here is 
 a small example list of things that could slow down online games:</p>

<ul type="disc" class="whs4">
	
	<li class=kadov-p><p>Translation filters for incoming text</p></li>
	
	<li class=kadov-p><p>Error logging</p></li>
	
	<li class=kadov-p><p>Obscenity filters</p></li>
	
	<li class=kadov-p><p>High end lighting effects</p></li>
	
	<li class=kadov-p><p>High graphic details</p></li>
	
	<li class=kadov-p><p>In-game viewing distance</p></li>
</ul>

<p>&nbsp;</p>

<p class="whs3">Although this is not as big of a problem now 
 as it was in the past, some older Internet routers can slow down due to 
 online traffic. This most often occurs during peak traffic times, from 
 3 PM PST (GMT 8 PM) to 10 PM PST (GMT 6 AM).</p>

<p class="whs3">&nbsp;</p>

<p class="whs3">Make sure that you have all the required ports 
 open so that the game can successfully send and receive information, thus 
 improving your online experience. The full port information can be found 
 in your manual.</p>

<p class="whs3">&nbsp;</p>

<p class="whs3">Be sure that your connection meets the speed 
 requirements for the game. The minimum Internet connection speed is listed 
 with the minimum requirements on the bottom of the box.</p>
