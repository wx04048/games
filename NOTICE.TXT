We, RELOADED members, would like You - Dear User, to know the following:

1.  We do not want You to spread our releases outside of The Scene.
2.  Do NOT contact technical support if You have some issues with our releases.
3.  We hate Peer2peer networks (torrents, bearshare, ...), rapidshare etc.
4.  We do not make our releases for yOU - Mr. P2P user, we make them for
    The Sceners, who contribute something - unlike yOU.
5.  To all people who repack our cracks/keygens with spyware/malware: FUCK YOU        
6.  We do NOT fix game bugs, unless we can.

And the most important:

7.  IF YOU LIKE THIS OR ANY OTHER GAME:  BUY IT!!!  (Yes, we mean it)
